;;; Now we consider the following procedures,
;;; and give them concise mathematical definitions
;;; for positive integer values of n:

;;; By the above definition of A,
;;; f multiplies n by 2:
(define (f n) (A 0 n))

;;; As we saw in the caculations above,
;;; g returns 2^n:
(define (g n) (A 1 n))

;;; Can't get this last one:
(define (h n) (A 2 n))

;;; This one is obviously K(n) = 5n^2
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
